This repository features a collection of projects that I have completed. Here are a few notes about each:

Bootstrap-V5\
This website focuses on HTML/CSS and was constructed using Bootstrap for styling and SASS and my CSS preprocessor.  It takes the form of a fake company webpage, and shows off some in-depth styling techniques.

Flooring Mastery\
A CRUD console application that features dependency injection utilizing interfaces.  It is 
capable of swapping between in-memory and a SQL server database.

Guild Cars\
My capstone project for the .NET/C# development course that I took through The Software Guild.
It features many technologies including .NET/C#, ASP.NET, MVC, SQL, HTML Razor, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Student Information System\
A student repository that was completed after receiving partial code of the initial project.  
I was able to complete the program as a MVC app that allows you to track students and their courses.

Vending Machine\
A fully functional vending machine web-page that consumes a REST API.  It heavily features
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that allows for a dynamic user experience.
