					<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
					<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-winter-9bb09471/" target="_blank"> <img src="images/portrait-resize.jpg" alt="Portrait of Jonathan Winter" style="width: 300px;" /> </a>
					<p>My name is Jonathan Winter, and I am learning to become a C# Software Developer.  I originally went to college
					to become an accountant and graduated with my <strong> bachelor of science in accounting </strong>. After a few years in the 
					accounting field, I have decided to change my career path to coding.  I have always had a fascination with computers and 
					programming, and feel that this <strong> new career path </strong> is a better fit for me. </p>
					<p>I grew up in a small town in southern Minnesota, went to school in Marshall, Minnesota, and have landed my true home up in
					the twin cities.  I have been living in the south metro for almost four years now and find the city entrancing.  I can't wait 
					to keep exploring new places and find new favorites for years to come.</p>

					 <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>

					<p>Although my past experience is largely rooted in the accounting side of business, I feel that I will be able to translate 
					that well into effective code.  I have worked in a few different accounting positions, but most recently have been working with 
					telecommunications companies and preparing financial and tax filings for them.  I work closely with my clients to ensure that 
					deadlines are met, and that work is done in an efficient manner.</p>
					<p>As an accountant, I had an <strong> extremely high-attention to detail </strong> and have experience in reviewing and auditing pieces of financial 
					information for errors.  I believe that this will help me while I'm learning to become a software developer and will give me the edge 
					once I have started my career in the programming field.</p>

					<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
					<a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/dice-d20-game-role-d12-d8-rpg-2351448/" target="_blank"> "<img src="images/dice.jpg" alt="Pile of RPG dice" style="width: 300px;" /> </a>
					<p><span style="background-color:red"> <span style="color:purple"> I have many hobbies that I love sharing with my friends, including Roleplaying Games (like <strong> Dungeons and Dragons 
					</strong> and <strong> Pathfinder </strong>), computer games, board games, camping, hiking, and running. </span></span>  I have been playing 
					RPG style games for many years and it has become a large part of my life recently.  I love introducing new people to the world 
					of roleplaying and giving them an oppurtunity to use their imagination to fuel their creative side, and <strong> challenging 
					people to think outside the box </strong> to solve problems.</p>
					<p>Over the summer of 2020, I started running with the intent to complete a 5k in under 30 minutes.  I tried to run a little bit every 
					day to ensure that I was making progress towards my goal by running a little bit faster, and a little bit farther every time I got outside. 
					I finally accomplished my goal after two months of consistent practice and determination.  I try to apply this concept to everything I do, 
					including trying new games, exploring new places in the twin cities, and also teaching myself to code and become a successful developer.</p>
