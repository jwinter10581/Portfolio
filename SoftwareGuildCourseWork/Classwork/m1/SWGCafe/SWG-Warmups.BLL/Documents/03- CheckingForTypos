3 - Checking For Typos

So sales are booming and everyone is having a fun morning guessing if they are going to get the discount or not. 
However, some of our baristas are so excited to get the sale complete they are typing in names incorrectly which 
is leading to people feeling like they are getting cheated. We decided that the most common mistake was people typing 
in the same first letter or last letter twice. 

Given a person’s first name, return the name removing any instances of duplicate first letters or last letters from the name.
