5 - No Bad Words

So some of our barista's liked to start throwing bad words into customer’s names (and say that is what the customer told them 
their name was). So we need to clean up any “bad” names.

Given a person’s name, remove any instances of the phrase “bad” and return the name. (Note, a person’s name can be less than 3 letters)
