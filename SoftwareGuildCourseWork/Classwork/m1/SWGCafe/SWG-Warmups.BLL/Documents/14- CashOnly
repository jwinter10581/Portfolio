14 - Cash Only

We installed a new machine that allows our customers to put in dollars and coins to pay for their purchase. 
However, we have been tasked with making sure that we have been given enough money.

Given a price of a purchase, a number of dollars, number of quarters, number of dimes, number of nickels, 
and number of pennies, return if we have been given enough money to make the purchase.
