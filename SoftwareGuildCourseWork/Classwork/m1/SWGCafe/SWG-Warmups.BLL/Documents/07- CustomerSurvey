7 - Customer Survey

On every receipt we give the customer a phone number to go fill out a survey and they press a number (1-10) to 
describe their quality of experience (10 being the best). While we may want to do more with this survey later, 
for now we just want to know the number of customers that scored us at an 8 or higher. 

Given an array of integers, return the number of times an 8 or higher appears.
