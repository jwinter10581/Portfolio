1 - Name of the Day

Here at Software Guild Cafe, we are sure to enter the customer's name with 100% accuracy so we can print labels with their name 
out when their super-cha-latte-espresso with extra whipped cream is ready. Also, each day we randomly give people whose first names 
start with a specific letter 50% off their order. 

Given a person’s first name, a letter of the day, and a total dollar amount for an order, return a double with the cost of their order. 
(Hint - If no name is entered, then there is no chance of a discount for the customer.)
