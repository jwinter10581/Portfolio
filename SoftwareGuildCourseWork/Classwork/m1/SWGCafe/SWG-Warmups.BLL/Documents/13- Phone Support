13 - Phone Support

If the store is closed, we do not answer the phone. If it is the morning time, we do not answer the phone because we are so busy. 
However, if we recognize the number on the caller ID as the District Manager we pick it up as quick as possible regardless 
of what time it is.

Given if the store is open, if it is the morning, and if it is the District Manager - determine if we should answer the phone or not.
