2 - Random Letter Discount

Too many people started lying about their names and profit margins started to shrink at the cafe. So marketing decided to 
try this new random discount so if a “random” place in your name contained the special letter, you’d get that same 50% off 
your order. 

Given a person’s first name, a letter of the day, the position in their name to check, and a total dollar 
amount for an order, return a double with the cost of their order. 
(Note, if for some reason the person’s name is too long, we count the last letter in their name)
(Hint - a string is a array of char)
(Hint - a lower case letter and upper case letter are not equal to each other)
