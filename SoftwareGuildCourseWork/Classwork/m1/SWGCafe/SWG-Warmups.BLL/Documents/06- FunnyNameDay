6 - Funny Name Day

For April Fool’s Day we decide to run a promotion where the label that prints off for the customer’s cup blows 
up their name by changing it to their first letter, followed by the first two letters, etc. 
(For example, Alex becomes AAlAleAlex). 

Given a person’s name, expand the string like in the example. (See the unit tests for more examples)
