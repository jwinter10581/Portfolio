12 - Staffing Needs

Our normal staffing needs for the day are 6 people. During the winter time, we need 2 additional people to help 
the additional traffic. During the weekends we need an additional 3 people on top of that to meet our customer’s 
needs and go for that “10”.

Given if it is the winter and if it is the weekend, return the number of staff we need.
