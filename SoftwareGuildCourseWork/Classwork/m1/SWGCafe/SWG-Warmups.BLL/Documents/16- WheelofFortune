16 - Wheel of Fortune

Hangman was such a hit they want us to add a new spin on it (literally). You will spin a wheel and get a point value. 
For each letter you find, you get that number of points. If you choose a vowel (‘a’,’e’,’i’,’o’,’u’), you get half as many points 
for each letter. 

Given a target word, a letter guess by a customer, and a point value. Return the number of points earned.
